# Forking Notes
Open-source notetaking software with a focus on using specific tags attached to notes in order to filter them more easily.

# What is this tool about?
It's supposed to be some improvized tool for creating notes, tagging them and then searching for them by tag or possibly note content.
Obsidian is a nice tool for taking notes, but I can't use it at work, because of its commercial license.

# Current state of the tool
Currently the code is quite terrible, but at least the application somewhat works.

As I'm using it, some bugs will be discovered and fixed, some features will be needed and implemented and maybe even the whole application would change, based on how I'm using it.

Commit messages will not always make sense, as I'm trying to push as many features at the same time as possible, but I'm not in the mood to split them into multiple specialized changelists. I'm also a solo dev, so I will prioritize personal convenience over doing things as if I'm in a professional environment...

# How to use it?
Well, there is no release for this app yet. If you want to use it, just install .NET 8 and build the app yourself (I use Visual Studio 2022 for this). Eventually I might work on some official releases, but so far I'm the only user, so it's a waste of time to make it more user-friendly.
