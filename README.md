# Forking Notes
Open-source notetaking software

# What is this tool about?
It's supposed to be some improvized tool for creating notes, tagging them and then searching for them by tag or possibly note content.
Obsidian is a nice tool for taking notes, but I can't use it at work, because of its commercial license.

# Current state of the tool
Currently the code is terrible and the tool doesn't work.

I am trying to implement as many features as possible in order to end up with a usable thing.

Commit messages will not make sense, as I'm not in the mood to split the insane amounts of fixes/features I write into multiple commits. It's just too much wasted time at this point.

Eventually when things start working and there's less work, I could start cleaning up the code and have actually meaningful commits messages.
